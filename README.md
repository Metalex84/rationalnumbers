# Rational aumbers
A set of typical operations between rational numbers:

- Addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of two rational numbers
- Absolute value, exponentiation of a given rational number to an integer power, exponentiation of a given rational number to a real (floating-point) power, exponentiation of a real number to a rational number
- Aux functions to get GCD and to set properly the sign of a rational number (if the "minus" went to denominator instead of numerator).
